===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

# Running and Playing the Game
### Running
To run the game all you need to do is open the `index.html` file and the game will start in the browser window.

### Playing the Game
To play the game just press one of the directional arrows keys to move the character in that direction. Try to get to the other side without touching the bugs.

## Rules for the Game
* The player must make it to the other side of the street to where the water is.
* They must not touch the bugs. Player will be reset back to start if they do.
* When the player reaches the water they win and the game resets.

### Known Issues
* Pressing more than one key at a time will sometimes cause it not to register the new key press until both keys are released.
* Some bugs move very slow _this was left in because I think it is funny_
